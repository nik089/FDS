1. What is a Queue?
      A Queue is a linear data structure that follows:

      FIFO – First In, First Out
===> The element that enters first is removed first.

Real-life example
A line at a bank counter:
      First person in line → served first
      New people join at the end

Core Operations:
| Operation          | Meaning                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **enqueue(x)**     | Add an element to the **back** of the queue |
| **dequeue()**      | Remove an element from the **front**        |
| **front / peek()** | View the front element without removing     |
| **isEmpty()**      | Check whether the queue has no elements     |
========================================================================================================

Visual Example:
              Start with an empty queue:
                                      [  ]

              Enqueue 10, 20, 30:
                              Front → [10, 20, 30] ← Back

              Dequeue:
                     Front → [20, 30] ← Back
==========================================================================================================
enqueue(10);
enqueue(20);
enqueue(30);

Front → [10, 20, 30] ← Rear

dequeue()

Front → [20, 30] ← Rear

===========================================================================================================
Where queues are used:
              Queues are widely used in systems where order matters, such as:
              Task scheduling (CPU job scheduling)
              Printing systems (print jobs go in order)
              Handling requests in servers
              Breadth-first search (BFS) in algorithms
              Messaging systems / event queues
              Async programming and buffering (network packets, IO)

============================================================================================================
Variants of Queues:

1. Simple Queue (Normal Queue)
    Insert at rear
    Remove from front

2. Circular Queue:
    Last position connects back to first
    Used to save memory

3. Priority Queue:
    Element with highest priority is removed first
    FIFO is not followed strictly

4. Deque (Double-Ended Queue):
    Insert and delete from both ends
==============================================================================================================
Time Complexity:
          Enqueue: O(1)
          Dequeue: O(1)
