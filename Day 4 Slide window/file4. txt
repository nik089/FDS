1️⃣ Method Name
  Sliding Window Technique

2️⃣ What is Sliding Window? (Simple Definition)
  Sliding Window is a technique where:

  We maintain a “window” (subarray / substring) and move it step by step instead of recalculating everything again.

Instead of:
  Recomputing sums/counts for every subarray (brute force)

We:
Reuse previous computation
  Slide the window forward

3️⃣ Why is Sliding Window Used?
Because brute force solutions often do this:
for i
  for j
    calculate again

⏱ Time: O(n²)
  Sliding Window converts this to:

4️⃣ When Should You Use Sliding Window?
  Use Sliding Window when the problem has:
  Subarray
  Substring
  Continuous elements
  Window size (k)
  Maximum / minimum / sum / count
❌ Do NOT use when elements are not continuous.


5️⃣ Types of Sliding Window
  1️⃣ Fixed Size Window
  Window size = k

Example: max sum of subarray of size k

2️⃣ Variable Size Window
  Window size changes dynamically
Example: longest substring without repeating characters
