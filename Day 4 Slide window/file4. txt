1. What is the Sliding Window Technique?
    The Sliding Window technique is an optimization strategy used to process contiguous
    subarrays or substrings efficiently by maintaining a “window” that moves over the data instead
    of recalculating values repeatedly.

Instead of recalculating from scratch for every possible subarray, you:
Expand the window by adding elements
Shrink the window by removing elements
Maintain relevant state (sum, count, frequency, max, min)

1️⃣ Method Name
  Sliding Window Technique

2️⃣ What is Sliding Window? (Simple Definition)
  Sliding Window is a technique where:

  We maintain a “window” (subarray / substring) and move it step by step instead of recalculating everything again.

Instead of:
  Recomputing sums/counts for every subarray (brute force)

We:
Reuse previous computation
  Slide the window forward

3️⃣ Why is Sliding Window Used?
Because brute force solutions often do this:
for i
  for j
    calculate again

⏱ Time: O(n²)
  Sliding Window converts this to:

4️⃣ When Should You Use Sliding Window?
  Use Sliding Window when the problem has:
  Subarray
  Substring
  Continuous elements
  Window size (k)
  Maximum / minimum / sum / count
❌ Do NOT use when elements are not continuous.


5️⃣ Types of Sliding Window
  1️⃣ Fixed Size Window
  Window size = k

        Add new element (right)
        Remove old element (left)
        Move both pointers forward

Example: max sum of subarray of size k

2️⃣ Variable Size Window
  Window size changes dynamically
Example: longest substring without repeating characters
        Expand window → condition breaks
        Shrink window → condition valid

5. How Sliding Window Works (Step-by-Step)
Example: Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K

    Array: [2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2], K = 3

      1.First window: [2,1,5] → sum = 8
      2.Slide window:
          Remove 2
          Add 1
          New sum = 7
      3.Continue until end
      4.Track max sum

  Time Complexity: O(n)
  Space Complexity: O(1)

==============================================================================
let windowSum = 0;
let maxSum = 0;
let left = 0;

for (let right = 0; right < arr.length; right++) {
  windowSum += arr[right];

  if (right >= k - 1) {
    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
    windowSum -= arr[left];
    left++;
  }
}

===============================================================================
3. When Should You Use Sliding Window?
Use Sliding Window ONLY IF ALL CONDITIONS APPLY:
Data structure is array or string
Problem involves contiguous elements

You are asked for:

Maximum / minimum
Longest / shortest
Count of valid subarrays / substrings
A brute-force solution uses nested loops
Keyword Triggers in Questions
“subarray”
“substring”
“continuous”
“window”
“longest”
“maximum sum”
“at most / at least”
