// Floyd’s Algorithm, also called the Tortoise and Hare algorithm, is a two-pointer technique used to:

// Detect a cycle in a linked list
// Find the starting node of the cycle (advanced but commonly asked)
// It works in O(n) time and O(1) space, which is why it is preferred in interviews.

function hasCycle(head) {
  let slow = head;
  let fast = head;

  while (fast && fast.next) {
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next.next;

    if (slow === fast) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}


// Step 1: slow = B, fast = C
// Step 2: slow = C, fast = E
// Step 3: slow = D, fast = C
// Step 4: slow = E, fast = E  ← MEET
// Cycle detected


// 5. Algorithm Steps (Detection Only):

                                // 1. Initialize:

                                //         slow = head
                                //         fast = head

                                // 2. Loop while fast and fast.next exist:

                                //                                 slow = slow.next
                                //                                 fast = fast.next.next

                                // 3. If slow === fast → cycle exists
                                // 4. If loop ends → no cycle
