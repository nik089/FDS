1️⃣ Method Name
    Brute Force Approach

2️⃣ What is it?
    Brute Force means:
        Try all possible solutions and check the condition directly until you find the answer.
        There is no optimization, no shortcuts — just correctness.

Technically:
    Uses nested loops
    Checks every combination
    Guarantees correct result

3️⃣ Why it is used?
    Brute Force is used because:
    It is the simplest way to solve a problem
    Helps understand problem requirements
    Acts as a baseline solution

    Interviewers want to see your thinking process first
👉 Every optimized solution starts from brute force.

4️⃣ When it is used?
Use Brute Force when:
    Input size is small
    You want to validate logic
    You are learning a new problem
    In interviews, as the first explanation

Avoid when:
    Input size is large
    Performance is critical

5️⃣ Time & Space Complexity
Time Complexity:
    Usually O(n²) (because of nested loops)
Space Complexity:
    Usually O(1) (no extra memory)
